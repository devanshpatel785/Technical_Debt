Testing Debt
-> Pushed the changes without testing
-> Feature developed without Unit test
-> Generating false object detection warnings on both front & rear sides under specific scenarios(Traffic) in China region. Vehicle test is not performed in China. Its performed in India.
-> Lack of Automation test/ technical blocker to automate: Lead time for test is more
-> Repeatative failure handling/ Wrong Test procedures
-> SW release without unit test and code coverage (Since no time left for quality topics) 
-> Only software LAB testing performed to ensure features working

Design Debt:
-> Sw Arch design: Code done first followed by Arch design documentation for some usecases.

Documentation Debt
-> Traffic scenarios are not covered in vehicle test document
-> No detailed design documentation done before SW release 
-> Also no system and software requirement update before SW release (Since customer requirement came before one week of code freeze)

Code debt:
-> Cleanup of taken over code of previous gen platform pending
-> Introduced initial version of module (Concept taken over form other project and made simplified) 
-> SW released without in depth techinical review from peer developers or architects (only top level review)

Process Debt:
-> Release being delayed
-> Dependencies not addressed/resolved on time
-> Changes impacting the component being shared at last moment leading to quick fixes
