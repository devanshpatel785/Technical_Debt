Below are the techincal debts observed in projects over past 6 months

1. Code debt
-> Introduced initial version of module (Concept taken over form other project and made simplified)
-> SW released without in depth techinical review from peer developers or architects (only top level review)
   
2. Documentation debt
-> No detailed design documentation done before SW release
-> Also no system and software requirement update before SW release (Since customer requirement came before one week of code freeze)

3. Testing Debt
-> SW release without unit test and code coverage (Since no time left for quality topics)
-> Only software LAB testing performed to ensure features working
